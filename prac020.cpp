Maximum sum of Non-adjacent nodes
MediumAccuracy: 55.35%Submissions: 60K+Points: 4
Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node,
 we need to choose a subset of these nodes such that sum of chosen nodes 
 is maximum under a constraint that no two chosen node in subset should be 
 directly connected that is, 
 if we have taken a node in our sum then we canâ€™t take its any 
 children or parents in consideration and vice versa.

 Input:
     11
    /  \
   1    2
Output: 11
Explanation: The maximum sum is sum of
node 11.

Input:
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    /     /  \
   4     5    6
Output: 16
Explanation: The maximum sum is sum of
nodes 1 4 5 6 , i.e 16. These nodes are
non adjacent.

/*
Building the Tree: Before we can calculate the maximum sum of non-adjacent nodes,
 we need to build the binary tree from the given input string. Building the tree involves parsing the input string and creating nodes. This process has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

Calculating Maximum Sum: The solve function is called recursively for each node in the tree. At each node, we perform constant time operations to calculate the maximum sum of non-adjacent nodes. Since we visit each node once, the time complexity of this step is also O(N).
